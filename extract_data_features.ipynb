       "'\"A feast worthy of Gods\"  Baccarnal Buffet in Caesar Palace is consider the best buffet in the Las Vegas by most food critics   It rated highest in trip advisor and yelp for a buffet restaurant in Vegas.  I was only going to eat Buffet once in this trip, so I decided must try the best there is available.  My review is based on late breakfast and lunch during a non-holiday weekday.  Finding this place is confusing and take more than five minutes from the main entrance to get here, this is common in most buffet in the strip.    Admission Price *Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99 *Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99 * Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99 * Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends  * Holiday expect to paid $10 more. * Total Reward Card Holder gets $1 off. * Price not included the 8.1% sales tax.  Atmosphere The interior is similar to those of mid-level restaurant, they claim it cost 17 million that might not felt like it perhaps they included all the equipment and kitchen tools in to the cost.  There is a lot of seating, but do not count it those do not mean anything during dinner and weekend which can get full very quick.  The dessert section is separate counter from the rest of the food.  Customer Service We got assign an individual server, at first she was helpful but quickly kind of forgot our table.  This was not during a weekday lunch so is not busy; there is was still several table empty.  Imagine in dinner or weekend, the service might be worst. The nicest thing is that they did not enforce the 2 hours eating time limit as they normally do in a busy time.   During peak hours, you would need to get an estimated waiting time in a kiosk machine,   Beverage You can to choose variety of juice and coffee.  Some yelper was right that the juice they serving were no longer freshly squeezed, but instead are concentrate and probably are pre-made package.  At this price tag, they should had keep the fresh juice instead of during the cheap way.  I was told that the Mexico Section would had fresh juice and Hocharta but never came out.  Breakfast The item in the breakfast was the best part of the hot food section I think.  The typical American favorite food like Scramble Egg and Fried Chicken are just perfect in term of texture and flavor.  The dim sum was disappoint, it tasted like those cheap takeout place.   Seafood At this price they don\\'t had crab leg for lunch, I heard Aria is the only in the strip serve cheaper.  I can settle with no crab leg as long the other item in the seafood make up for it.  However, it failed to impress me at all.  The got the jumbo shrimp cocktail, looks good but tasted plain.  Probably the worst jumbo shrimp I\\'ve tasted.  The oyster was small and wasn\\'t much flavor either, lack freshness.  The smock salmon was not that great either, they got three version and all were no good.  Sushi was ok, I like the sushi rice it was authentic one, however the tuna wasn\\'t good.  But salmon was alright.  There was no specialty or hand roll here.  Noodle Section Skip this one, it was the worst section in the buffet I think.  They use pre-packed noodle, not even the good kind.  I try their Ramen, they use nissin kinds of noodle.  The broth was supposed to be Tonkotsu it tasted more like Shoyu.  There was tiny slice of chashu.  If they wanted to had this type of item, better get it right.  The pho was slight better but still no even close to the real Pho you can from any shop in L.A.  Meat Section I tried their sausage and beef ribs, it was mediocre at best.  The person that cutting the meat is cool with smile.  There was no lamb chop for lunch, but they do serve prime ribs. The best food in the hot section were the sliders, those were mouthwatering.   I should had get more of those.  I think the burger were prime meat it was extreme flavorful.  Actually, it tasted better than the Gordon Ramsey Hell Burger, which later I eat that night.  The made to order taco wasn\\'t good.  It tasted like king taco and other cheap taco place.  Dessert Section They dessert has variety of food but nothing really won me over except one item.  Their made to order crepes were the best dessert easily. Fresh and with the right texture, I added the ice cream which was heavenly match.  Their Crème brûlée was too watery.  Fruit and Salad They were pretty good in general, Large selection of salads.  You won\\'t get disappoint here.  Just wish they were more fruits.  My 2 Cents To be honest I am debating giving this 4 or 3 stars, I ended gave a four since there few dish were excellent and the best I had (Sliders, Crepes, Fried Chicken) .  But many other dish were average and even bad..  The price is the problem, they need to better quality and included more crab leg or lamb chop to worth the price.  I didn\\'t get any food sickness after eating here over 2 hours which is a good sigh that the food is prepare it right.'"
